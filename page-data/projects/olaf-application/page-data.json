Users can create an account as either a customer or chef for different user experiences. As a chef, the user can create food items to post online. (Photos can be added to the online items through the use of Cloudinary.) Once the chef is online, their address is converted to geo-coordinates using the Geocoding API, and the chef's location is placed on a map using Google Maps API. Now the customer can search the map to find online chef's and shop for items to add to their cart. Once a customer has completed checkout, the customer and chef are notified of order details via text message through the use of Twilio. This application was created using React and MDBootstrap on the front end. Data is stored in a MySQL database with the use of Sequelize NPM.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./news-collection.gif\" alt=\"What?\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Olaf","date":"7 days ago","slug":"/olaf-application","tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"posttype":"project","subtitle":"Location-Based, FoodCommerce Application","category":"E-Commerce","primaryTech":"JavaScript","github":"https://github.com/wandrew8/dictionaryApp","website":"https://wandrew8.github.io/dictionaryApp/#/","featuredImage":null,"lightboxImages":[null,null]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/olaf-application","category":"E-Commerce","tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"prev":{"frontmatter":{"tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"category":"E-Commerce","posttype":"project","slug":"/hangman-application"}},"next":null}}}
