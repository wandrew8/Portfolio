At its core, it’s a glorified webpack app, where everything gets built upon that same webpack pipeline that you’ve struggled to write and fully understand to this day (or maybe that’s just me).</p>\n<p>The beauty, though, is that what it outputs is a static website (simple HTML file) with your application pre-rendered for optimal delivery. This means it can essentially run anywhere, like simply dumping it in S3 and serving it as a static webpage or even easier, have Netlify build and serve it for you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our Second Post","date":"June 11, 2020","slug":"/second-post","tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"posttype":"project","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAOABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQD/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAYtYVo0sif/EABkQAQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMhE//aAAgBAQABBQI5CN6M9jJJ2X//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAMR/9oACAEDAQE/AXNbl//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREv/aAAgBAgEBPwHav//EABkQAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABECExkf/aAAgBAQAGPwK2Ua+TrP/EABsQAQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAIRExQXGx/9oACAEBAAE/ISHwdwzi3TEHTCVcIUcTJinqf//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQ39//xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMZHw/9oACAEDAQE/EEkt2KuO0f/EABgRAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESEx/9oACAECAQE/EADVR12f/8QAHxABAAIBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhADFRgXGRsdHw/9oACAEBAAE/EHywbfD3iigENKUqO2JhZNgWHnJTCTk6ZYCNhjJXjRV5z//Z","aspectRatio":1.4814814814814814,"src":"/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/14b42/coral2.jpg","srcSet":"/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/f836f/coral2.jpg 200w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/2244e/coral2.jpg 400w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/14b42/coral2.jpg 800w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/47498/coral2.jpg 1200w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/0e329/coral2.jpg 1600w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/portfolio/static/fb9409c519c6917d109b0f2696f259bf/6b48d/coral2.jpg 1940w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/second-post","category":"UI Design"}}}
