At its core, it’s a glorified webpack app, where everything gets built upon that same webpack pipeline that you’ve struggled to write and fully understand to this day (or maybe that’s just me).</p>\n<p>The beauty, though, is that what it outputs is a static website (simple HTML file) with your application pre-rendered for optimal delivery. This means it can essentially run anywhere, like simply dumping it in S3 and serving it as a static webpage or even easier, have Netlify build and serve it for you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our First Post","date":"June 10, 2020","slug":"/first-post","tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.5617977528089888,"src":"/static/714c0cfd94e6a2ed9cf808e45d0f1d83/14b42/canyon.jpg","srcSet":"/static/714c0cfd94e6a2ed9cf808e45d0f1d83/f836f/canyon.jpg 200w,\n/static/714c0cfd94e6a2ed9cf808e45d0f1d83/2244e/canyon.jpg 400w,\n/static/714c0cfd94e6a2ed9cf808e45d0f1d83/14b42/canyon.jpg 800w,\n/static/714c0cfd94e6a2ed9cf808e45d0f1d83/9f406/canyon.jpg 842w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/first-post","category":"UI Design","tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"category":"Design","posttype":"post","slug":"/second-post"}}}}}
