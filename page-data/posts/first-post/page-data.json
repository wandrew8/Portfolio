At its core, it’s a glorified webpack app, where everything gets built upon that same webpack pipeline that you’ve struggled to write and fully understand to this day (or maybe that’s just me).</p>\n<p>The beauty, though, is that what it outputs is a static website (simple HTML file) with your application pre-rendered for optimal delivery. This means it can essentially run anywhere, like simply dumping it in S3 and serving it as a static webpage or even easier, have Netlify build and serve it for you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our First Post","date":"June 10, 2020","slug":"/first-post","tags":["HTML","CSS","SCSS","React","Gatsby"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/14b42/art2.jpg","srcSet":"/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/f836f/art2.jpg 200w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/2244e/art2.jpg 400w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/14b42/art2.jpg 800w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/47498/art2.jpg 1200w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/0e329/art2.jpg 1600w,\n/wandrew8.github.io/Portfolio/static/4fd1226239e6c49f1abf9648e472adbe/53d6a/art2.jpg 1950w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/first-post","category":"UI Design"}}}
