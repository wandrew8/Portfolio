At its core, it’s a glorified webpack app, where everything gets built upon that same webpack pipeline that you’ve struggled to write and fully understand to this day (or maybe that’s just me).</p>\n<p>The beauty, though, is that what it outputs is a static website (simple HTML file) with your application pre-rendered for optimal delivery. This means it can essentially run anywhere, like simply dumping it in S3 and serving it as a static webpage or even easier, have Netlify build and serve it for you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our Second Post","date":"June 11, 2020","slug":"/second-post","tags":null,"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/14b42/coral.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/f836f/coral.jpg 200w,\n/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/2244e/coral.jpg 400w,\n/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/14b42/coral.jpg 800w,\n/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/47498/coral.jpg 1200w,\n/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/0e329/coral.jpg 1600w,\n/static/7269deecae5deac7713bfbf2a5ad5e57/60b22/coral.jpg 2089w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/second-post","category":"Design","tags":null,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"tags":null,"category":"UI Design","posttype":"post","slug":"/first-post"}},"next":null}}}
