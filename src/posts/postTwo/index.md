# Gatsby is Awesome!

## Why you should be using Gatsby today

I like to describe it as Create React App on steroids, where it’s an easy way to bootstrap a React application and focus on getting productive with the truly different parts of your application. At its core, it’s a glorified webpack app, where everything gets built upon that same webpack pipeline that you’ve struggled to write and fully understand to this day (or maybe that’s just me).

The beauty, though, is that what it outputs is a static website (simple HTML file) with your application pre-rendered for optimal delivery. This means it can essentially run anywhere, like simply dumping it in S3 and serving it as a static webpage or even easier, have Netlify build and serve it for you.
