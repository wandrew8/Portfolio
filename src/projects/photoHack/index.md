The task for this hackathon was to build an application using a photo API. I ended up using the pixabay API and hit various endpoints to allow the user to search for free stock images based on color, category or keyword. I utilized the light Pure.CSS framework for styling along with styled components. I also used the react-image-lightbox package for a dynamically-created lightbox component.
