## Get a weather forecast for your location

Weather Forecaster is a searchable, mobile responsive application that provides weather info for the user's current location, a five-day weather forecast, Fahrenheit - Celsius conversion, Weather news articles, location mapping, and even a weather report from Mars. It fetches data from various web APIs including: NASA, openweather, zipcodeapi, and newsapi. Map navigation capabilities were added through the open layers third-party library.
