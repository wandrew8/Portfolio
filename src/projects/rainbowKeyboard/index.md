## Improve Your TYping Skills and Learn some fun facts

Rainbow Keyboard is simple desktop typing application that makes typing fun. Once the user clicks the start button, writing prompts are appended to the page for the user to type. Once the answer is submitted with a click of the enter key, a new prompt takes the place of the old one. The fun audio and constantly changing colors as the user types, make this an exciting game to play.
