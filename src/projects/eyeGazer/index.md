This hackathon's objective was to build an application with the webgazer.js library. Webgazer.js is an eye-tracking library that uses webcams to infer eye-gaze location on a page in real time. This project also takes advantage of the heatmap.js library to map eye movements and show hotspots in the user's attention. The frontend UI was built with Sakura for normalize.css and Materialize for components. This was a great chance for me to get comfortable in using new libraries and leveling up my vanilla JavaScript skills.
