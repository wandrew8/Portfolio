## Find Local and National Parks Near You

This website was built using bootstrap and was constructed in an attempt to broaden and deepen my understanding of bootstrap components. This site takes advantage of many of bootstrap's features including: toolkits, modals, accordions, nav-tabs, navbars, cards, tables, grid-system, utility classes, forms, and more. This site also makes a call to the National Park Service API to pull information about national parks and points of interest in the area. Users can can visit the linked sites of each spot, or with the use of OpenLayers maps, find the location of each sight on the map with the click of a button.
