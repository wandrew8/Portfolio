## Search a Vast Movie Database for the Perfect Movie

Movie Finder is a full-stack application built using Node, Express and MongoDB on the backend, with server-side rendered HTML templating with Mustache for frontend views. This application allows users to search films through the vast database with data provided by kaggle.com. Searching is easy with many filter options to search based on streaming service, genre, or age group, and sorting options allow the user to sort results based on year of release, Rotten Tomatoes score or IMdb score. Once a user has created an account, they can add movies to their favorites, or a watchlist as well as add reviews to films. This application was built with classmates as part of a final project for a backend development course in JavaScript. It includes a number of CRUD routes, complex database queries, as well as extensive unit testing of all the express routes.
