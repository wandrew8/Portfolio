This hackathon's objective was to build a currency converter. I built my converter using the exchangeRateAPI for up-to-date exchange rate data. I built the application using React and decided to focus on showcasing just a handfull of currencies rather than all of the currencies available from the API. I used contryflags.io along with the contry codes to display country flags.
