The task for this hackathon was to build expand on an existing color generator application. I added a number of new features including the ability to switch between hex and RGB values, a swatch component to select preset colors, the ability to copy color values to the clipboard, and many styling upgrades. This was a great project to learn about some cool new libraries as keep improving my React skills.
