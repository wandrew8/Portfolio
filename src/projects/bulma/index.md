This hackathon's objective was to build a website using the Bulma CSS framework. I decied to make Oscar-nominated films the focus of my website. I utilized react-router-dom for routing of the website and used many components available in the Bulma library. It was a great chance to learn more about this framework and review my understanding of react and react-router-dom.
