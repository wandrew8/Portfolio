## Keep your team on task and productive

An easy to use productivity application that allows the user to set up a family account. The user can create todo lists for each family member and send their lists to them via email or sms message using the nodemailer and twilio APIs. User information is not stored locally, but utilizes a backend database to create, query and delete user information and tasks assignned to team members. The frontend was designed with MDBootstrap and is fully mobile responsive.
