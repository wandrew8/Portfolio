MintBean Hackathon: Today's hackathon tast was to build a weather application utilizing a weather API. I decided to use the Weather API for data and built this small application using React. I focused a lot of my attention to creating a clean, simple design and was adament on adding animation SVG images to add to the UI for an enhanced user experience.
