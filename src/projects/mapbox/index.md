This hackathon's objective was to build an application using MapBox. For my project I built a search engine using the zipcode API to get the geolocation latitude and longitude coordinates required to use MapBox. I used the city data obtained from this API as well to hit a wikipedia endpoint and pull up information about the searched city to display along with the map. I used Sass / SCSS along with grid and flexbox for styling.
