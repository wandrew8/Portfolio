The challenge for this week's hackathon was to build a trivia-based application using svelte. I utilized the open trivia database API for fetching trivia data on a wide range of topics at varying degrees of difficulty. I also integrated lottie animations to add to the overall user experience and to communicate when answers were submitted correctly or incorrectly. Coming from react land, I really enjoyed working with Svelte. Many of the concepts carried over nicely, but svelte improved on some pain points of working with react such as working with forms.It's also awesome that svelte has transition animations built in. Overall this was a fun challenge and a great way to dive into learning new technologies.
