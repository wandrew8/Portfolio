The challenge for this week's hackathon was to build a chatbot application with the Botkit library. I decided to sync my chatbot with the OMDB API to fetch movie data when prompted by the user. This simple site was built from the botkit starter codebase and further expanded with materialize for modal and navbar UI components. This was a fun hackathon, but it took some time getting used to all of the different methods available in the botkit library. This application is quite basic in functionality, but it provided a good look into how chatbot technologies work.
