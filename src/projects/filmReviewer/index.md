## Search and Share Reviews to All your favorite films

This is a React Native application built using the Expo CLI, which uses data from the OMDb API to allow users to search through the film catalogue, view film information, scroll through top rated films from various genres, and add comments for popular films. This application utilizes many third-party libraries to create a clean and friendly UI.
