## Forum for Leadership and Reconciliation

Forum for Leadership and Reconciliation is a company website created for a client to display company news and information. The client's original site was not complete, full of broken links and unadequate for the client's needs. Using much of the same content, I restyled the website from scratch and added a number of new features including the ability to scrape blog posts from the client's blog to display in the news section of the website, utilizing the youtube data api to display videos from the client's youtube channel, a contact form that is functioning and connects user messages to the client's email address, as well as many design effects like parallax images, animation on scroll and lightbox image galleries.
